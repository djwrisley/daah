# Digital Literacy Reflection: A Visual Arts Student's Perspective

As a 20-year-old Visual Arts major navigating an increasingly digital world, I've come to recognize that digital literacy extends far beyond knowing how to use Adobe Creative Suite—though those skills certainly remain central to my discipline. Digital literacy, in my current understanding, encompasses the ability to critically engage with technology, understand visual data in its multiple forms, and communicate effectively across digital platforms. This reflection explores my journey through digital competency and how interdisciplinary perspectives are reshaping my approach to my studies.

## My Current Digital Toolkit

In my daily academic life, I rely heavily on specific platforms and software that have become extensions of my creative identity. The Adobe Creative Suite—Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects—remains my primary toolkit for digital illustration, photo manipulation, video editing, and motion graphics. For digital painting and illustration, I use Procreate on an iPad with an Apple Pencil. For research and inspiration, I navigate platforms like Behance, Pinterest, and Instagram, which have taught me the importance of visual trends, community engagement, and curating a professional online portfolio. These platforms have taught me different literacies—how to present my work professionally online, how to find inspiration and connect with other artists, and how to engage with creative communities.

Content creation, for me, has primarily taken the form of visual art and multimedia projects. I've learned to construct compelling visual narratives through my artwork, from single illustrations to short films. However, this course has challenged me to think beyond traditional artistic formats. I'm beginning to explore how data visualization, interactive art, and even creative coding might communicate artistic concepts more effectively than static images or linear videos.

## Learning from Interdisciplinary Peers

The diversity in this room—Computer Science majors, Finance students, Engineers, Environmental Studies specialists, and Creative Writers—has fundamentally altered my perspective on what "digital" means. A Computer Science student approaches problems with algorithmic thinking, while a Finance major considers data and markets. An Environmental Studies major might focus on data visualization for complex climate systems, whereas an Engineering student thinks about optimization and systems design.

This interdisciplinary exposure has revealed significant gaps in my literacy. I've realized that my creative process, while intuitive, often lacks a structured, data-informed approach. A classmate's approach to interactive data visualization has shown me how to present complex ideas in ways that are both aesthetically compelling and intellectually engaging. Similarly, learning about critical perspectives on technology from Literature and Creative Writing majors has prompted me to question assumptions I make about the neutrality of visual media—images are always contextualized, created by someone, for someone's purposes.

## Digital Humanities as a New Horizon

The digital humanities framework offers me fresh approaches to visual arts itself. I'm discovering that humanistic inquiry—asking why, considering multiple narratives, examining power structures—can enrich my creative practice. For instance, understanding the historical narratives around art movements, the ethical dimensions of representation, or the human stories behind cultural artifacts transforms how I create and interpret images. The digital humanities encourage me to think of visual culture not just as a collection of aesthetic objects but as a form of data deserving of critical interpretation and computational analysis.

## Collaboration and Computational Thinking

Through collaborative projects in this course, I'm developing what I initially understood as purely technical "computational thinking" into something richer. Working with peers from different disciplines, I'm learning to break complex creative problems into component parts (decomposition), recognize patterns across different domains, and abstract general principles from specific examples. A Computer Science student taught me basic creative coding with p5.js; applying this to generate interactive art opened new creative possibilities.

Collaboration has shown me that computational thinking isn't exclusive to programming—it's a problem-solving approach that transcends disciplines. When an Engineering student and I worked on a projection mapping project, their systems-thinking approach revealed technical solutions I'd missed working alone.

## Critical Reflection and Future Directions

Honestly assessing my digital abilities, I recognize I'm fluent in my discipline's tools but relatively narrow in my digital literacy. I'm proficient with creative software but less confident in using data or code in my art. My comfort with visual platforms hasn't translated into broader technological literacy or critical engagement with technology's social implications.

This course has revealed how much I'm discovering—not just new tools, but new ways of thinking. I'm developing genuine curiosity about AI and machine learning, not as abstract concepts but as tools that might reshape creative expression. I want to explore how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to create new forms of art or how machine learning can be used to analyze large visual datasets.

Looking forward, I want to develop literacy around AI ethics, digital ownership, and the responsible use of creative technologies. I'm interested in exploring how analytical problem-solving from the sciences and finance might complement my creative intuition. Most importantly, I'm learning that digital literacy isn't a destination but an ongoing practice of critical engagement with technologies that increasingly mediate how we see and create our world.

# Digital Literacy Reflection: A Visual Arts Student's Perspective

As a 20-year-old Visual Arts major, my world is one of images, textures, and narratives. I came to this course thinking of digital literacy as proficiency in the Adobe Creative Suite, the digital tools of my trade. I now see it as something far more expansive: a critical framework for understanding how technology shapes our perception, our creativity, and our interactions with the world. It’s about learning to be a creator, not just a user, in a digital-first world.

## My Current Digital Toolkit

My creative process is deeply intertwined with digital tools. I live in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and I use Procreate on my iPad for sketching and digital painting. For video projects, I turn to Premiere Pro. These are my digital brushes and canvases. For inspiration and community, I’m constantly scrolling through Behance, Instagram, and Pinterest, curating mood boards and following artists who push the boundaries of their craft. These platforms have taught me a visual literacy of trends, composition, and color, as well as the social literacy of building a following and engaging with a creative community. My content creation is almost entirely visual—illustrations, animations, and short films. This course, however, is pushing me to think about how I can incorporate data, interactivity, and even code into my art. The idea of creating a data visualization that is also a piece of art, or an interactive installation that responds to its audience, is a new and exciting frontier for me.

## Learning from Interdisciplinary Peers

Being in a room with students from Computer Science, Finance, and Literature has been a revelation. I’ve always thought in terms of aesthetics and narrative, but a Computer Science major thinks in algorithms and systems. A Finance major sees the world through data and models. A Literature major brings a critical lens to the stories we tell with technology. This interdisciplinary environment has highlighted the limitations of my own perspective. I’ve realized that my work, while visually driven, could be so much richer with a more structured, data-informed approach. A conversation with a Finance student about market trends sparked an idea for a series of illustrations about economic inequality. A chat with a Literature student about narrative structure gave me a new way to think about storytelling in my animations.

## Digital Humanities as a New Horizon

The concept of digital humanities is completely new to me, and it’s blowing my mind. The idea that we can use computational tools to analyze art and culture is a powerful one. I’m starting to think about how I could use digital tools to explore art history, to find patterns in visual culture that would be impossible to see with the naked eye. What if I could map the evolution of color palettes in Renaissance painting, or track the spread of a particular visual meme across the internet? Digital humanities offers a way to bridge the gap between my creative practice and a more analytical, research-based approach to art. It’s a way to make my art smarter.

## Collaboration and Computational Thinking

I’ll admit, the term “computational thinking” was intimidating at first. I’m an artist, not a coder. But through collaborative projects, I’m starting to see that it’s not about becoming a programmer. It’s a way of thinking, of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Working with a Computer Science student on a simple interactive art project using p5.js was a breakthrough. I was able to bring my visual ideas to life in a new way, and I learned the basics of a new creative tool. Collaboration has been the key. It’s shown me that I don’t have to be an expert in everything. I can bring my creative vision to a team and work with others who have different skills to create something that none of us could have made on our own.

## Critical Reflection and Future Directions

This course has been a mirror, reflecting back to me both my strengths and my weaknesses. I’m a strong visual communicator, but I’m a novice when it comes to data and code. I’m comfortable in the world of creative software, but I have a lot to learn about the critical and ethical dimensions of technology. I’m excited to explore the world of creative coding, to learn how to use tools like p5.js and Processing to create interactive and generative art. I’m also fascinated by the potential of AI and machine learning to create new forms of visual expression. What does it mean to collaborate with an algorithm to create a piece of art? What are the ethical implications of using AI to generate images? These are the questions I want to explore. I’m realizing that digital literacy is not a technical skill to be mastered, but a lifelong practice of critical inquiry and creative exploration. It’s about learning to see the world with new eyes, and then finding new ways to share that vision with others.
